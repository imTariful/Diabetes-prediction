# Diabetes-prediction
A machine learning model to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians dataset. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.), evaluation metrics, and visualizations. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which includes various health-related attributes:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Outcome (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy – for data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

Scikit-learn – for model building and evaluation

📈 Workflow
